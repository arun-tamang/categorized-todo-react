reduce all components to stateless.
only use refresh tokens in header if you want to refresh.
display message when login fails.
user session storage and only set accesstoken in header.
show wrong email or password error by first sending error from backend and catching it in
front end.
Currently add from sets value only on change if you put value and add todo, and again press add
without modifying present todo. So like in search you need extra state variables to store new add
title.
Do something for when refreshToken expires.
Add status flags: isFetching, isSearching, isEditing, isDeleting. (or waitingForResponse flag).
make tags dynamic in backend.
how will you do pagination with search ? (onclick of page nos. should now request different url)



fix this: search when you click search without changing input will send empty keword for search,
instead of sending current value. This happened when i removed ref and made searchForm stateless.
I need a way of accessing current value of input field when i click search. I fixed by keeping a
searchValue in state which get updated on calling onChange of input. But i want a better method
because this is increasing my code length.

i need to fix search by tags in backend because it returns result from another user also.
